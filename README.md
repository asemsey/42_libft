# 42_libft

The `libft` library was created as a part of the 42 curriculum to help students gain a deeper understanding of C programming. It includes implementations of many standard library functions (such as `strlen`, `strcpy`, `memset`, etc.) and also provides additional functions for manipulating linked lists. This library is designed to be used in other C projects, ensuring a solid grasp of essential programming concepts including memory management.

## Installation

To use `libft` in your project, clone the repository and compile the library:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:asemsey/42_libft.git
cd 42_libft
make
```
